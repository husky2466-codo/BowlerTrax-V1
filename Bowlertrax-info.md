LaneTrax uses advanced Edge AI and Computer Vision technology to provide real-time bowling performance analytics directly through a mobile device. 
Key components of their AI technology include:
Computer Vision (CV): The system uses a smartphone's camera to identify and track the bowling ball throughout its path. This allows for the calculation of precise metrics such as rev rate, ball speed, and entry angle without requiring external sensors like expensive lidar systems.
Latent AI Edge Technology: LaneTrax utilizes specialized technology from Latent AI to process complex AI models locally on the smartphone (at the "edge"). This provides several benefits:
Low Latency: Data is processed instantly, allowing for immediate feedback and video replays after a shot.
Efficiency: The AI models are compressed to be lightweight enough to run on standard mobile hardware without compromising accuracy.
Predictive Analytics: The AI engine provides "spare predictions" and historical performance insights by analyzing patterns in the bowler's data over time.
